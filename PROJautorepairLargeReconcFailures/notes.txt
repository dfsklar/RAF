This is when I was ignoring only 'X':
 Number of IGNORED lines: 29
 Number of manifests loaded: 19427
 ^^^ of the above, how many are ambiguous: 1672
 Number of lines with no manifest: 0


This is when I was only allow 'A':
 Number of IGNORED lines: 29
 Number of manifests loaded: 19373
 ^^^ of the above, how many are ambiguous: 1662
 Number of lines with no manifest: 0
So clearly, there are some manifests that are represented only via 'I' status.

What about if I allow all?
 Number of IGNORED lines: 29
 Number of manifests loaded: 20466
 ^^^ of the above, how many are ambiguous: 1915
 Number of lines with no manifest: 0
So clearly, there are some manifests that are represented only via 'X' status!
Well that makes sense really, as perhaps the 'X' and 'I' manifests exist but are NOT referenced
by any ent assignment.


SO: for first stab, let's accept only 'A' and see how many entassignments cannot be restored because of this.
